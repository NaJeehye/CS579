Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan has denied receiving any notice from the Enforcement Directorate over allegedly smuggling foreign currency out of India. "It would have been better if the authorities would have served the notice first if any and then publicised this," reads a press release issued on behalf of Rahat. The statement further called the allegation "bizarre".
